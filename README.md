# Sampling by diffusion, flows and autoregressive networks
Repository contanings the notebooks and codes to reproduce the results presented in the paper:
"Sampling with flows, diffusion and autoregressive neural networks: A spin-glass perspective"

## Codes
To be able to reproduce the simulations, it is required to install the following packages:
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
The codes for the SE equations, AMP and Sampling are in the folder *Codes*

### Analysis
Inside the folder *Analysis* we put the Python code necessary to reproduce our simulations

### Data
The folder *Data* contains all the data frames, and files which are needed to run the notebooks in the folder *Analysis*

### Figures 
The folder *Plots* contains all the plots of the paper, obtained directly from the notebooks present in the folder *Figures*.
